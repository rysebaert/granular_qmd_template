# Review data and methods : OpenStreetMap data and associated routing engine (OSRM) to build novel data on rural areas in Europe

## Context

This repository aims at feeding the Horizon Europe project *Giving Rural Actors Novel data and re-Useable tools to Lead public Action in Rural areas project* ([GRANULAR](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101061068)). 
More precisely, it correponds to activites held in the Working Package 3 *Novel open data sources for rural areas*, task 3.1 (*Screen rural data sources and methods*) and 3.2 (*Explore options, performance and costs*).


## Abstract

This [working paper](https://granular_riate.gitpages.huma-num.fr/review_data_methods/) makes a review of the literature and data availability in order to provide an overview of possible solutions and limitations for creating accessibility indicators at European context. 

Whatever the solution retained, computing accessibility indicators requires relevant origins / destination pairs and routing engines for computing travel-time indicators. It is afterward possible to propose a large set of indicators derived from these measures. 

The first part of the document presents at European scale the policy context and the main initiatives developed so far for proposing harmonized indicators on accessibility. The second section makes an overview of existing databases and possibilities that could be considered in a European context for the selection of origins / destinations pairs. The third part highlights existing solutions for routing engines according to several transportation modes (road, cycle, transport-transit). The last section discusses on possibilities offered in term of indicator creation when the travel time matrix is calculated with a case-study on hospitals in France. 

This case-study could be extended in a cross-border context to test this framework within GRANULAR activities. At the end, this report aims at providing a general research framework on the activities that will be held on task 3.3.1 of the GRANULAR project : Crowd-sources data based on OpenStreetMap.
