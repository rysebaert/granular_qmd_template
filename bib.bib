abstract = {This study proposes new family-centered measures of access to early care and education (ECE) services with respect to quantity, cost, and quality and uses them to assess disparities in access across locations and socio-demographic groups in Minnesota. These measures are distance-based and use available geographic data to account for the fact that families can cross arbitrary administrative boundaries, such as census tract or ZIP code lines, and thus better reflect the real experiences of families than conventional area-based measures. Combining synthetic family locations simulated from Census demographic and geographic data and information on ECE provider locations, we calculate travel time between the locations of families with young children and ECE providers to measure families’ access to providers of different types. The results yield a map of areas with low and high relative ECE access. The average family in Minnesota lives in a location where there are nearly two children for every nearby slot of licensed capacity, however, access to ECE supply varies considerably at the local level. The supply measure can also serve as a weight useful in computing family-centered measures of ECE quality and access costs, incorporating both prices and travel costs, to further characterize the local ECE market from the perspective of families. Improving the measures of variation in families’ access to ECE quantity, cost, and quality is valuable as policymakers consider expansions to public supports for early learning and ECE entrepreneurs decide where to invest.}

abstract = {An important goal of land use and transport policies is improving accessibility to services. Access to services differs significantly between different territories, and regional development policies, including Cohesion Policy, are often used to improve accessibility where it is too low. Unfortunately, comprehensive data on facility locations is not available in Europe, making it difficult to evaluate, ex-ante, the direct or indirect effects of policies on service distribution and accessibility to services. This study proposes a novel approach to cope with this problem and maps generic service accessibility in Europe. First, it defines three types of generic services with different minimum number of users and characteristics: local, subregional and regional services. Next, it uses this to simulate the spatial distribution of services, and to assess probable accessibility to services across Europe. Based on the simulation results, the paper explores how per country accessibility to services differs between metro regions, and between urban and rural areas in terms of I) average distance to services and II) the share of population within a short enough distance that could be walked or cycled. It tests the proposed method by comparing actual service points with the modelled points in a selected number of countries.}

However, the provision of resources and opportunities will differ across the broad spectrum of settlements that range from small towns to megacities, and access to this spectrum of settlement sizes should also be measured. Here we present a suite of nine global travel-time accessibility indicators for the year 2015, at approximately one-kilometre spatial resolution, for a range of settlement size classes. We validated the travel-time estimates against journey times from a Google driving directions application across 1,511 2° × 2° tiles representing 47,812 journeys. We observed very good agreement, though our estimates were more frequently shorter than those from the Google application with a median difference of −13.7 minutes and a median percentage difference of −16.9%.}

In these cities, a cyclist’s freedom of movement is considerably greater than a motorist’s. The objective of this article is to highlight and operationalize this principle for the first time. For this purpose, a FP index has been developed and calculated in 60 cities throughout the world. The results demonstrate that the freedom of movement of a cyclist in a European city is on average 44% greater than a motorist’s, which is a FP level about three times greater than what was measured in the other geographic areas studied (South and Central America, North America, Asia and Oceania). As other well-known factors (e.g. safety, accessibility, traffic calming measures), FP could be an effective dimension to create a conducive urban environment for cycling and thus, promote more sustainable mobility behaviours.}

abstract = {Automated construction of location graphs is instrumental but challenging, particularly in logistics optimisation problems and agent-based movement simulations. Hence, we propose an algorithm for automated construction of location graphs, in which vertices correspond to geographic locations of interest and edges to direct travelling routes between them. Our approach involves two steps. In the first step, we use a routing service to compute distances between all pairs of L locations, resulting in a complete graph. In the second step, we prune this graph by removing edges corresponding to indirect routes, identified using the triangle inequality. The computational complexity of this second step is $$\mathscr{O}(L^3)$$, which enables the computation of location graphs for all towns and cities on the road network of an entire continent. To illustrate the utility of our algorithm in an application, we constructed location graphs for four regions of different size and road infrastructures and compared them to manually created ground truths. Our algorithm simultaneously achieved precision and recall values around 0.9 for a wide range of the single hyperparameter, suggesting that it is a valid approach to create large location graphs for which a manual creation is infeasible.}

The main objectives of this study are: (1) to evaluate accessibility by travel time between a given population grid cell and the nearest airport/HSR station, by accounting for both motorized vehicles and public transport; and (2) to measure and visualize the size of catchment area of an airport or a HSR station. We automatize the computation of free-flow road travel times, as well as the public transit times (by bus, subway, light-rail, tram and railway), from grid cells to infrastructure elements, by using a scalable routing framework. The Chinese air transportation network and HSR network are used as case studies to elaborate and evaluate the efficiency of our proposed framework. We find that the HSR network for China is much better accessible for the population than airports. Furthermore, grid cells with a high population density are much better connected to the Chinese transportation networks than other grid cells. Our methodology is generic in that it can be applied on an even larger scale (whole planet) and with different points of interest. Our work can help provide decision support for airport competition, privatization, and regulation, and for policy makers in infrastructure investment, in particular potential market and the location of new infrastructure elements.}

This longitudinal dataset contains travel time and distance information between all 250 metres statistical grid cell centroids in the Capital Region of Helsinki, Finland. The dataset is multimodal and multitemporal by nature: all typical transport modes (walking, cycling, public transport, and private car) are included and calculated separately for the morning rush hour and midday for an average working day. We followed a so-called door-to-door principle, making the information between travel modes comparable. The analyses were based primarily on open data sources, and all the tools that were used to produce the data are openly available. The matrices form a time-series that can reveal the accessibility conditions within the city and allow comparisons of the changes in accessibility in the region, which support spatial planning and decision-making},

 abstract={The R package gdistance provides classes and functions to calculate various distance measures and routes in heterogeneous geographic spaces represented as grids. Least-cost distances as well as more complex distances based on (constrained) random walks can be calculated. Also the corresponding routes or probabilities of passing each cell can be determined. The package implements classes to store the data about the probability or cost of transitioning from one cell to another on a grid in a memory-efficient sparse format. These classes make it possible to manipulate the values of cell-to-cell movement directly, which offers flexibility and the possibility to use asymmetric values. The novel distances implemented in the package are used in geographical genetics (applying circuit theory), but also have applications in other fields of geospatial analysis.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the findings from the “Transport and Environment” (VEU) project related to the development of transport demand in Germany in three scenarios up to the year 2040. The results were obtained using the German national transport model DEMO, a complex model landscape covering all areas of transport (both passenger and freight), trip purposes and modes. The main findings are expressed in terms of number of trips, mode shares and distance travelled by mode. The results show that it is possible to push the transport sector toward a more sustainable state if comprehensive policy measures are established to reduce road transport and make other modes of transport more attractive. In the Regulated Shift scenario, the distance travelled on the road is 20% lower for passenger transport and 4% lower for freight transport compared to the Reference scenario. However, our results also indicate that road transport will still be the backbone of the future transport system in all scenarios, meaning that the mitigation of the environmental effects is only possible in combination with technological developments of road-based transport systems.}

abstract = {Access (the ease of reaching valued destinations) is underpinned by land use and transport infrastructure. The importance of access in transport, sustainability, and urban economics is increasingly recognized. In particular, access provides a universal unit of measurement to examine cities for the efficiency of transport and land-use systems. This paper examines the relationship between population-weighted access and metropolitan population in global metropolitan areas (cities) using 30-min cumulative access to jobs for 4 different modes of transport; 117 cities from 16 countries and 6 continents are included. Sprawling development with the intensive road network in American cities produces modest automobile access relative to their sizes, but American cities lag behind globally in transit and walking access; Australian and Canadian cities have lower automobile access, but better transit access than American cities; combining compact development with an intensive network produces the highest access in Chinese and European cities for their sizes. Hence density and mobility co-produce better access. This paper finds access to jobs increases with populations sublinearly, so doubling the metropolitan population results in less than double access to jobs. The relationship between population and access characterizes regions, countries, and cities, and significant similarities exist between cities from the same country.}
